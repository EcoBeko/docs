# EcoBeko's Documentation ðŸ’¬

Documentation is powered by [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org), therefore main README file is located [here](src/docs/README.md) but it's preferable to access the generated docs since all the linking (images, sources) is done for generated version only, here's the link: [eco-beko.ryspekov.life/docs](https://eco-beko.ryspekov.life/docs).
